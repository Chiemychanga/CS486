1. (10 pts) Describe (briefly) three advantages that a DBMS provides over an
application using simple file i/o for data persistence.

2. (10 pts) In the format of
TableName1(Attribute1, Attribute2, Attribute3,…)

Describe a schema that can store data for a pet grooming shop, including the
services they provide, their customers, their customers' pet(s), and a history
of the grooming that has been performed. Underline the attributes making
up the primary key of each table. Describe foreign keys in a separate line,
like:
  Attribute2 is a foreign key from Table3.

These parts are based on the Spy relational database, on dbclass.cs.pdx.edu

Part Two (10 points per item)

Give the English request that could have resulted in each of the SQL queries below (see
Part Two for examples). (Don’t just paraphrase the SQL into words.) Also include the
total number of rows returned.

3.

(a) SELECT * FROM Mission WHERE mission_status = 'ongoing';
(b) SELECT meeting_frequency FROM team;
(c) SELECT DISTINCT meeting_frequency FROM team;
(d) SELECT DISTINCT A.city FROM Agent A WHERE A.salary > 180000
 AND A.country = 'USA';
(e) SELECT lang_id FROM LanguageRel where agent_id=56;

4.

(a) SELECT * FROM Agent A, SecurityClearance S
 WHERE A.salary < 51000
 AND (S.sc_level = 'Secret' OR S.sc_level = 'Majestic')
 AND A.clearance_id = S.sc_id;

(b) SELECT A.agent_id, A.first, A.last, A.city, A.country
 FROM Agent A, SkillRel SR, Skill S
 WHERE A.agent_id = SR.agent_id AND SR.skill_id = S.skill_id
 AND S.skill = 'Sniper';

Part Three (20 points each)

Write a single SQL statement for each of the following queries. Show the first five rows
of the result for each query (or fewer, if the result is smaller) and the number of rows
returned. You should be able to write these SQL queries using only the features covered
in the first week's lecture notes.

5. What are the team names and IDs that meet monthly?

6. Which teams have agents with Majestic clearance?
(Your query shouldn’t depend on what clearance IDs are used for these clearance levels,
just the names of the levels.)

7. What are the ids and last names of all agents who speak at least two languages?
(You can do this without COUNT.)

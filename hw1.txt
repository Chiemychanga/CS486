1. (10 pts) Describe (briefly) three advantages that a DBMS provides over an
application using simple file i/o for data persistence (lifetime not bound to a process.
1. Isolation of data management for your application(s) from UI, business logic, many implementation specifics
2. Acid transactions (Atomic, consistent, isolated, durable)
3. Exposes a standard interface to your data (enables support engineering, reporting, ad hoc queries, pipelines to copy data

2. (10 pts) In the format of
TableName1(Attribute1, Attribute2, Attribute3,…)

Describe a schema that can store data for a pet grooming shop, including the
services they provide, their customers, their customers' pet(s), and a history
of the grooming that has been performed. Underline the attributes making
up the primary key of each table. Describe foreign keys in a separate line,
like:
  Attribute2 is a foreign key from Table3.

Services(ServiceID, Service, Price)

Customers(Number, LName, FName)

Pets(CustomerNumber, ID)
Pets.CustomerNumber is a foreign key that references Customers.Number.

History(Date, CustomerNumber, PetID, ServiceID)
History.CustomerNumber is a foreign key that references Customers.Number.
History.PetID is a foreign key that references Pets.ID.
History.ServiceID is a foreign key that references Services.ServiceID.

These parts are based on the Spy relational database, on dbclass.cs.pdx.edu

Part Two (10 points per item)

Give the English request that could have resulted in each of the SQL queries below (see
Part Two for examples). (Don’t just paraphrase the SQL into words.) Also include the
total number of rows returned.

3.

(a) SELECT * FROM Mission WHERE mission_status = 'ongoing';
What are the mission id's, names, access id's, team id's of 'ongoing' missions?
(b) SELECT meeting_frequency FROM team;
What are the meeting frequencies of all of the teams?
(c) SELECT DISTINCT meeting_frequency FROM team;
What are the unique meeting frequencies of all the teams?
(d) SELECT DISTINCT A.city FROM Agent A WHERE A.salary > 180000
 AND A.country = 'USA';
What cities have agents of salaries greater than $180,000?
(e) SELECT lang_id FROM LanguageRel where agent_id=56;
What language id's are in Agent 56's possess? 

4.

(a) SELECT * FROM Agent A, SecurityClearance S
 WHERE A.salary < 51000
 AND (S.sc_level = 'Secret' OR S.sc_level = 'Majestic')
 AND A.clearance_id = S.sc_id;
 What information is there about the agents and their security clearance that have a salary less than 51,000, a Security Clearance level of either 'Secret' or 'Majestic'? 

(b) SELECT A.agent_id, A.first, A.last, A.city, A.country
 FROM Agent A, SkillRel SR, Skill S
 WHERE A.agent_id = SR.agent_id AND SR.skill_id = S.skill_id
 AND S.skill = 'Sniper';
 What are the agent id, agent's first and last name, agent's city, and agent's country who are snipers?



Part Three (20 points each)

Write a single SQL statement for each of the following queries. Show the first five rows
of the result for each query (or fewer, if the result is smaller) and the number of rows
returned. You should be able to write these SQL queries using only the features covered
in the first week's lecture notes.

5. What are the team names and IDs that meet monthly?
SELECT name team_name, team_id 
FROM Team 
WHERE meeting_frequency = 'monthly'

6. Which teams have agents with Majestic clearance?
(Your query shouldn’t depend on what clearance IDs are used for these clearance levels,
just the names of the levels.)
SELECT DISTINCT T.name
FROM Agent A, Team T, SecurityClearance S
WHERE S.sc_level = 'Majestic'
AND A.clearance_id = S.sc_id 

7. What are the ids and last names of all agents who speak at least two languages?
(You can do this without COUNT.)
